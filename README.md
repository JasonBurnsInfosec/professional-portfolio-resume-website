# professional-portfolio-resume-website

This is just a simple template to use as a "resume" or "portfolio" or whatever you wanna call it website. 

Upload your headshot as profile.jpg under the /images. You can add a personal favicon under /images as well. 
Add your resume as resume.pdf under /resume. 
Edit index.html to change the data to be your own. 


Enjoy. Original credit to https://github.com/izzydoesizzy , who I stole the template from and added the resume download button. 

I personally use cloudflare's free page hosting. Only costs associated are my domain registration.
